The React application is encountering a critical issue in multiplayer mode: the falling Tetris pieces are not visible on either player's game board. The application seems to connect to the WebSocket server, but the game itself is not functioning correctly.

To resolve this, please investigate the following areas with a focus on how the falling pieces are managed and rendered in a multiplayer environment:

1.  **WebSocket Connection:**
    * The WebSocket connection error "Failed to construct WebSocket" is still present. This indicates an underlying issue with the WebSocket communication between the client and the server.
    * **Action:** Prioritize resolving this issue by carefully reviewing the WebSocket configuration and implementation on both the client and server sides. Ensure that the correct protocol, hostname, port, and path are being used for the WebSocket connection.

2.  **Game State Synchronization:**
    * Once the WebSocket connection is stable, thoroughly examine how the game state, specifically the current tetromino, its position, and the game board, is being synchronized between the server and the clients.
    * Use console logs on both the server and client to track the flow of game state updates.
    * Ensure that when a new piece is spawned or moved, this information is being correctly transmitted from the server to all connected clients.
    * Verify that the client is receiving these updates without errors and that the data is in the expected format.

3.  **Client-Side Rendering of Falling Pieces:**
    * Inspect the React components responsible for rendering the Tetris game board and the falling pieces, likely within the `MultiplayerLobby` component or a child component.
    * Ensure that these components are correctly subscribed to and receiving the relevant game state updates from the server.
    * Verify that the logic within these components correctly uses the received game state to determine the position and shape of the falling pieces and renders them using `react-konva` (specifically the `Stage`, `Layer`, and `Rect` components).
    * Pay close attention to how the `x` and `y` coordinates of the `Rect` elements representing the tetromino are being calculated based on the received game state.

4.  **Piece Spawning Logic in Multiplayer:**
    * Determine where the logic for spawning new Tetris pieces resides in multiplayer mode (server-side or client-side).
    * If the server handles spawning, ensure that it's correctly generating new pieces and broadcasting this information to the clients.
    * If the client handles spawning (which is less likely in a synchronized multiplayer game), ensure that the logic is consistent across clients and doesn't lead to discrepancies.

5.  **WebSocket Message Handling:**
    * Review the WebSocket event handlers on the client-side that are responsible for processing game updates from the server (e.g., handling events for new pieces, piece movements, board updates).
    * Ensure that these handlers are correctly parsing the incoming messages and updating the local game state that is used for rendering.
    * Check for any errors or unhandled exceptions within these event handlers that might be preventing the state from being updated correctly.

6.  **Initial Game State:**
    * Verify that the initial game state sent from the server to the clients upon joining the multiplayer session includes information about the current pieces or that the spawning process is triggered correctly after joining.

**Debugging Steps:**

* Add extensive logging on both the server and client to track the flow of game state, especially related to the current tetromino and its position.
* Use the React DevTools to inspect the props and state of the components responsible for rendering the game board in multiplayer mode.
* Examine the Network tab in the browser's developer tools to inspect the WebSocket messages being exchanged between the client and the server.

**Additional Considerations:**

* **WebSocket Protocol:** Ensure that both the server and client are using the same WebSocket protocol (ws or wss) and that the server is correctly configured to accept WebSocket connections.
* **Firewall or Security:** Check if any firewalls or security settings are blocking the WebSocket connection.
* **Browser Compatibility:** Ensure that the browser being used is compatible with WebSocket and that the necessary browser-specific extensions are enabled.

Focus on resolving the WebSocket connection issue first, as this is likely the root cause of the missing falling pieces. Once the connection is stable, thoroughly debug the game state management and rendering logic to ensure the pieces are correctly displayed in multiplayer mode.
