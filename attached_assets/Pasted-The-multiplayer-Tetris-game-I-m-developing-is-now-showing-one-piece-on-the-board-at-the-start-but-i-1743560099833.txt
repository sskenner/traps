The multiplayer Tetris game I'm developing is now showing one piece on the board at the start, but it is not automatically falling as expected in a Tetris game. The piece remains stationary.

The console output continues to show the following recurring error:

* `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` in `index-M3-19-67-2451`

The codebase is available at: https://github.com/sskenner/traps

While the rendering of the initial piece seems to be working now, the persistent `TypeError` suggests that the game loop or the function responsible for updating the piece's position and causing it to fall is encountering an issue. This could be due to:

* **Game Loop Issues:** The game loop that should be triggering the downward movement of the piece might not be running or is encountering an error before it can execute the movement logic.
* **Movement Logic Errors:** The function responsible for updating the piece's vertical position might have a bug, possibly related to accessing or updating the game state or board data, leading to the `TypeError`.
* **Timing or Interval Issues:** There might be a problem with how the falling interval is set up or cleared, preventing the movement function from being called repeatedly.
* **State Management:** The game state related to the active piece's position might not be updating correctly, preventing the re-render with the new position.

Could you please help me identify why the falling piece is not moving and address the remaining `TypeError`? I suspect the issue might be in the `TetrisGame.tsx` or related files that handle the game logic and state updates.

Here are some areas to investigate:

* **Game Loop Implementation:** Examine how the game loop is implemented (e.g., using `setInterval`). Is it correctly started when the game begins? Are there any conditions that might be preventing it from running?
* **Piece Movement Function:** Analyze the function that handles moving the piece down. Is it being called by the game loop? Are there any checks for undefined variables within this function that might be failing?
* **State Update Logic:** Review how the active piece's position is being updated in the game state. Is this update happening correctly and triggering a re-render?
* **Collision Detection (Initial):** While the piece isn't falling, it's worth considering if any initial collision detection logic might be prematurely stopping the movement.

Please provide the specific lines of code that are likely causing the piece to remain stationary and the `TypeError`, along with the suggested changes to implement the correct falling behavior. Focus on ensuring the game loop is running correctly and the piece's position is updated and rendered at regular intervals.
