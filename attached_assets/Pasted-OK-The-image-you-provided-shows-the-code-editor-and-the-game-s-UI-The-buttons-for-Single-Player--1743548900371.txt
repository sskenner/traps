OK. The image you provided shows the code editor and the game's UI. The buttons for "Single Player" and "Multiplayer" are visible in the game's UI.

It seems the issue is not with the logic of the `handleStartMultiplayer` function itself, but rather how it's connected to the button in the `MainMenu` component, or potentially a CSS styling issue preventing the button from appearing interactive.

Since I don't have access to the `MainMenu` component's code, I can't provide a direct fix. However, here are the most likely issues and how to resolve them. You will need to check the code for your `MainMenu` component and make the following adjustments:

1.  **Ensure the onClick handler is correctly attached:** Make sure the `onClick` event is correctly attached to the "Multiplayer" button. It should call the `onStartMultiplayer` prop that's passed down from the `HomePage` component. The button should look something like this:

    ```jsx
    <button onClick={onStartMultiplayer}>Multiplayer</button>
    ```

2.  **Verify the `onStartMultiplayer` prop:** Ensure that the `MainMenu` component receives the `onStartMultiplayer` prop and that it's correctly passed from the `HomePage` component.

    In `HomePage`:

    ```jsx
    <MainMenu
      onStartSinglePlayer={handleStartSinglePlayer}
      onStartMultiplayer={handleStartMultiplayer} // Make sure this is passed
    />
    ```

    In `MainMenu`:

    ```jsx
    const MainMenu: React.FC<{ onStartSinglePlayer: () => void; onStartMultiplayer: () => void }> = ({ onStartSinglePlayer, onStartMultiplayer }) => {
      // ...
      <button onClick={onStartMultiplayer}>Multiplayer</button>
      // ...
    }
    ```

3.  **Check CSS styling for pointer:** Ensure that there is no CSS that is preventing the cursor from changing to a pointer when hovering over the button. Check for CSS rules that might be setting `cursor: default` or other non-interactive cursor styles on the button or its parent elements. The default button style should automatically change the cursor to a pointer, but if there's custom CSS, it might be overriding this. You can try adding this inline style to the button:

    ```jsx
    <button onClick={onStartMultiplayer} style={{ cursor: 'pointer' }}>Multiplayer</button>
    ```

    If this works, then you know there's a CSS rule elsewhere that's interfering with the cursor.

4.  **Check for overlapping elements:** Verify that there are no other HTML elements overlapping the button, preventing the click event from being registered. Use your browser's developer tools to inspect the elements and ensure the button is the topmost element in that area.

By checking these potential issues in your `MainMenu` component, you should be able to resolve the problem with the "Multiplayer" button.
