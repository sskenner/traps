The multiplayer Tetris game I'm developing has a recurring error in the console:

`TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')`

This error appears to originate within the `TetrisBoard` component, specifically in the `index-CnMvfWfx.js` file, around line 67.

The codebase is available at: https://github.com/sskenner/traps

This error is preventing the game from functioning correctly, as seen in previous issues where the falling pieces were not rendering or moving. It's crucial to resolve this `TypeError` to ensure the game works as expected.

Could you please analyze the `TetrisBoard` component and the code in `index-CnMvfWfx.js` around line 67 to identify why this error is occurring? It seems like the code is trying to access the `length` property of a variable that is currently undefined.

Here are some areas to investigate:

* **Data being passed to TetrisBoard:** Examine the props being passed to the `TetrisBoard` component, particularly those related to the game board state or the current piece. Is any of this data potentially undefined at the time of rendering?
* **Accessing board or piece data:** Within the `TetrisBoard` component, review how the code accesses the data representing the game board and the current falling piece. Are there any instances where it assumes this data is always defined without proper checks?
* **Asynchronous data loading:** If the board or piece data is fetched asynchronously (e.g., via WebSocket), ensure that the rendering logic handles cases where the data is not yet available.
* **State updates:** Investigate if there are any issues with how the game state is being updated, potentially leading to a situation where the `TetrisBoard` receives an undefined value.
* **Logic around line 67 in `index-CnMvfWfx.js`:** Focus specifically on the code at or around line 67 in the mentioned file. What data is being accessed there, and why might it be undefined?

Please provide the specific lines of code in `TetrisBoard.tsx` (or any relevant parent component) and `index-CnMvfWfx.js` that are causing this `TypeError`. Suggest the necessary code changes to prevent this error, such as adding checks for undefined values or ensuring data is properly initialized before being used in the rendering process.

The goal is to eliminate this `TypeError` and ensure the `TetrisBoard` component can reliably render the game state.
