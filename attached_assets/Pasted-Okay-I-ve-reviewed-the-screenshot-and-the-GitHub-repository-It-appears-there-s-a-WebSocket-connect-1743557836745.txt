Okay, I've reviewed the screenshot and the GitHub repository. It appears there's a WebSocket connection error occurring in the Replit environment when trying to connect to `ws://trans2.replit.org/`. The error message "SyntaxError: Failed to construct 'WebSocket': The URL 'ws://localhost:undefined/?token=...' is invalid" suggests the client-side code is attempting to connect to a WebSocket server using an incorrectly constructed URL, specifically with `localhost:undefined`.

Here's a prompt you can submit to the Replit Assistant to help resolve this issue:

```
The multiplayer Tetris game I'm developing has a WebSocket connection error in Replit. The error message in the console is:

"SyntaxError: Failed to construct 'WebSocket': The URL 'ws://localhost:undefined/?token=...' is invalid."

The codebase is available at: https://github.com/sskenner/traps

Based on the error, it seems the client-side code is generating an invalid WebSocket URL, specifically with 'localhost:undefined' for the host. I suspect there might be an issue with how the WebSocket URL is constructed in the `MultiplayerLobby.tsx` or `MultiplayerGame.tsx` files, as these seem to be involved in setting up the WebSocket connection.

Could you please help me identify the source of this invalid URL generation and suggest a fix? I need to ensure the WebSocket connection is established correctly to the Replit-hosted server at `ws://trans2.replit.org/`.

Things to consider:

* **URL Construction:** Review how the WebSocket URL is built in the mentioned files. Are there any variables that might be undefined or incorrectly concatenated?
* **Environment Variables:** Is the WebSocket server address or port being pulled from environment variables? If so, are they correctly configured in the Replit environment?
* **Replit Specifics:** Are there any specific configurations or considerations when using WebSockets within Replit that I might be missing?

Please provide the specific lines of code that need modification and the suggested changes to resolve the invalid URL issue.
```

This prompt provides the Replit Assistant with:

* **Context:** The specific error message and the environment (Replit).
* **Code Location:** Potential files where the issue might reside.
* **Hypothesis:** A guess about the cause of the error (incorrect URL construction).
* **Specific Questions:** Guiding the assistant to look for URL construction issues, environment variable problems, and Replit-specific considerations.
* **Desired Outcome:** Requesting specific code changes to fix the problem.

By providing this detailed information, you'll help the Replit Assistant understand the problem better and provide a more targeted and effective solution.
