The multiplayer Tetris game I'm developing has a problem where the falling pieces are not being displayed on the game board. The UI shows the board, score, and next piece, but the active falling piece is missing.

The console output shows the following recurring errors:

* `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` in `index-M3-19-67-2451`
* `Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')` in `index-M3-19-67-2451`

The codebase is available at: https://github.com/sskenner/traps

Based on the error messages, it seems there's an issue with accessing a property of an undefined variable, specifically related to the `length` property. This likely points to a problem with how the game state or the board data is being managed and accessed during the rendering process.

Could you please help me identify the root cause of this error and why the falling pieces are not rendering? I suspect the issue might be in the `TetrisBoard.tsx` or related files responsible for rendering the game board and the active piece.

Here are some areas to investigate:

* **Game State Management:** Review how the game state, specifically the position and shape of the falling piece, is being managed. Is it being updated correctly? Is it accessible in the rendering function?
* **Board Data Structure:** Examine the data structure used to represent the game board. Is it being initialized and updated correctly? Is the rendering logic correctly accessing the relevant parts of this structure to draw the falling piece?
* **Rendering Logic:** Analyze the `render` function in `TetrisBoard.tsx` or any related rendering components. Are there any assumptions being made about the game state or board data that might be incorrect? Are there any missing checks for undefined variables before accessing their properties?
* **WebSocket Updates:** Consider if the game state related to the falling piece is being correctly received and processed via the WebSocket connection. Is there any delay or issue in updating the client-side state after receiving updates from the server?

Please provide the specific lines of code that are causing the `TypeError` and suggest the necessary changes to ensure the falling pieces are rendered correctly. Focus on identifying and fixing the issue related to accessing the `length` property of an undefined variable.
