The React application is experiencing issues in multiplayer mode:

1.  **WebSocket Connection Error (Potentially Related):**
    * The WebSocket server is running at `ws://0.0.0.0:5000/ws`.
    * The client is attempting to connect to `wss://localhost:undefined/`.
    * This discrepancy might still be impacting the real-time communication required for multiplayer gameplay, even if the initial connection succeeds.
    * **Action:** Please ensure the WebSocket connection is stable and correctly configured for multiplayer. Verify the protocol, hostname, port, and path used by the client to connect to the server.

2.  **Falling Pieces Not Showing in Multiplayer:**
    * When in multiplayer mode, the Tetris pieces are not visible or not falling on the game boards.
    * **Action:** Investigate the following areas to identify why the pieces are not showing:
        * **Game State Management:** Review how the game state (including the current tetromino, board state, and player positions) is managed in the multiplayer context. Ensure that the state is being correctly updated on the server and propagated to all connected clients.
        * **Server-Client Communication:** Examine the WebSocket messages being sent from the server to the clients regarding new pieces, piece movements, and board updates. Use console logs on both the server and client to verify the content and flow of these messages.
        * **Client-Side Rendering:** Inspect the React components responsible for rendering the game board and the falling pieces in multiplayer mode. Ensure that these components are correctly receiving and using the game state updates to render the pieces at the appropriate positions. Pay attention to how the `Stage`, `Layer`, and `Rect` components from `react-konva` are being used and if their props are being updated correctly.
        * **Piece Spawning Logic:** Verify that the logic for spawning new pieces is being triggered correctly in the multiplayer context. Check if the server is responsible for spawning pieces and notifying clients, or if the client handles this logic.
        * **Synchronization Issues:** Look for potential synchronization issues between clients. Are the game states on different clients consistent? Is there any lag or delay in receiving updates?
        * **Error Handling:** Check for any JavaScript errors in the console that might be occurring during the game loop or rendering process in multiplayer mode.

Please focus on ensuring that the game state is correctly managed and communicated between the server and clients, and that the client-side rendering is accurately reflecting the falling pieces in the multiplayer game.
