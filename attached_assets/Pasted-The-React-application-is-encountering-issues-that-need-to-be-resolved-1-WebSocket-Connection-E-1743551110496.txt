The React application is encountering issues that need to be resolved:

1.  **WebSocket Connection Error:**
    * The WebSocket server is running at `ws://0.0.0.0:5000/ws`.
    * The client is attempting to connect to `wss://localhost:undefined/`.
    * This discrepancy is causing a "Failed to construct WebSocket" error and preventing the multiplayer mode from functioning correctly.
    * **Action:** Please thoroughly investigate and correct the WebSocket connection logic to ensure the client connects to the server using the correct protocol (`ws` or `wss`), hostname, port, and path. Pay close attention to how the WebSocket URL is constructed in the client-side code, especially in relation to environment variables or hardcoded values. Ensure that if the server is using `ws://`, the client attempts to connect to `ws://` and if the server is using `wss://` the client attempts to connect to `wss://`. The client should be connecting to the correct port and path as well.

2.  **`useEffect` Error in `MainMenu` Component:**
    * The `MainMenu` component is throwing a "useEffect is not defined" error.
    * **Action:** Please ensure that the `MainMenu` component is correctly defined as a functional component and that the `useEffect` hook is imported from React if it's being used. If `useEffect` is not needed, ensure the component is a standard functional component.

3.  **Multiplayer Mode Not Starting:**
    * The game does not play once entered multiplayer mode.
    * **Action:** Investigate the multiplayer game initialization and rendering logic. Specifically:
        * Ensure that the correct game state and board are being initialized when the multiplayer mode is selected.
        * Verify that the client is correctly receiving and processing updates from the server to render the game board and pieces.
        * Check for any errors or exceptions that might be occurring during the multiplayer game setup or rendering process.
        * Confirm that the client and server are correctly communicating player actions and game updates.
        * Review any relevant WebSocket event handlers to ensure they're functioning as expected.

Please address these issues to ensure the application loads correctly, the WebSocket connection is established, and the multiplayer game mode functions as expected.
